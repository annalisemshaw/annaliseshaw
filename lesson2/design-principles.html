	<p>On the Mercedes Benz page, there is minimal text. The layout is very clean and sophisticated.
	There isn't a lot of information or things to click on. Which is a favorable layout for mobile browsing in my opinion. The viewport is limited as is. The navigation bar can ease the user by directing them to where they need to go. </p>

	<p>The Knot has a strong center alignment. The image has a cropped bottom edge that is curved. I think it gives some style to the page. When things are center aligned it can look ameteurish but the curved image offsets that. This isn't my favorite layout but what I do like is that the info on the page doesn't look messy and is straight forward.</p>

	<p>The BYU-I Canvas dashboad utilizes proximity very well. Your able to tell what assignment are due based on their proximity to the date listed on the page. The layout doesn't steer too far off from that of the canvas app. This makes it easy to maneuver throughout the web page if you are already familiar with Canvas. It shows that there is a good understanding of how they expect the user to use the site.</p>
