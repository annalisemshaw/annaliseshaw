	<p class="audience-answer">My site is for athletes who need to know what the weather conditions will be like on days where they will have to be outside! They need to know if they need to bring a jacket just in case there's a chance of rain. Or if the weather is not suitable for outdoor activities, they can be prepared for possible cancellations.</p>
