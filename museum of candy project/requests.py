    This function will read JSON (Javascrip Object Notation) data from the 
    United States Geological Service (USGS) consisting of earthquake data.
    The data will include all earthquakes in the current day.
    
    JSON data is organized into a dictionary.  After reading the data using
    the 'requests' library, this function will print out a list of all
    earthquake locations ('place' attribute) and magnitudes ('mag' attribute).
