                    <p class="about--p">
                        I was 19 years old when I decided to go to college, like many people, I felt lost in terms of what I should study.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about--p">
                        My dad has been a network engineer for over 30 years and ever since I was little he always reminded me of how it was a lucrative field to work in. With that in mind, I enrolled in college to become a network engineer. Only a few months had passed when I needed to find work to keep me afloat while attending school. I then came across a family who was in need of a nanny. After working for them for some time, the father, a vice president of technology at a software development company, asked me why I chose network engineering. I replied that my dad had done incredibly well in it so I thought I’d give it a shot. Little did he know I was frustrated in half of my classes and was looking for something more interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about--p">
                        After hearing my not-so-enthusiastic reply he suggested I work in software engineering or web development. He went on to mention that I am great at problem-solving, can multitask, and couldn’t see myself in network engineering. My initial reaction was, “Isn’t that hard?” He could only laugh and say that it’s a lot like working on a puzzle. You code a bunch of smaller pieces to have the end result be worth far more than the sum of its parts. After our conversation, I went home and thought, “Should I really do this?” I don’t know a thing about programming or coding. But I had nothing to lose since I was only in my first semester and couldn’t stand the thought of another network engineering class.

                    <p class="about--p">
                        The following semester I switched all of my classes over to front-end web development and at first, I had my doubts but once I got the hang of it I fell in love with how there were endless possibilities as to what I can create. I not only learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but I went on to learn Python, C++, and React.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about--p">
                        Now I am 23 years old, a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho with an Associate’s Degree in Applied Physical Sciences,  and went from being lost to being glad I found a career path that I’m not only proud of but love.
